WIP uxntal stuff

## yooxnas.py

I'm currently working on a uxntal assembler in python. It's far from complete, but it can already tokenize and parse many examples (Lexer + Parser). I added an Intermediate Representation and a Pass 2 now, too. It even outputs working ROMs now. I'm in the process of cleaning it up and fixing the command line arguments (e.g., be able to specify an output file instead of `output.rom` every time :)).
